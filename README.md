# Works-and-Publications

Hey!
If you're here and trying to think what to look at first, you can go ahead to my thesis.

There you will find a poster presentation and a pptx that sums up my thesis research, the thesis paper itself, and a code file -
python code that contains data preprocessing, basic analysis (regarding relation between variables) of the data which I collected in my research, followed by a stepwise regression algorithm (actually 2 of them, one for prediction and one for classification) that I built. This algorithm intended to optimize feature selection.

There is another chunk of the project that will not be there due to copyrights, but was part of the project (the missing piece if you may): A Wolfram Mathematica code that creates a multiplex network (graph) and then computes measures for each participant based on their responses in the experiment. I did not create this code myself (one of the contributing authors did) which is why it is not here.

This research was published in a The Journal of Research in Personality:
